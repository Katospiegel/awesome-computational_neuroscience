Manually curated collection of resources for computational neuroscience.

## Courses

* [Computational Neuroscience](https://www.coursera.org/course/compneuro) - Computational Neuroscience Mooc on Coursera.

## Simulators

* [Brian](https://www.briansimulator.org) - Brian is a simulator for spiking neural networks based on Python.
* [Nengo](http://www.nengo.ca/) - Nengo is a software package for simulating large-scale neural systems.
* [Nest](http://www.nest-simulator.org/) - NEST is a simulator for spiking neural network models that focuses on the dynamics, size and structure of neural systems rather than on the exact morphology of individual neurons.
* [Neuron](https://www.neuron.yale.edu/neuron/) - Neuron is a simulation environment for building and using computational models of neurons and networks of neurons.
* [STEPS](http://steps.sourceforge.net/STEPS/default.php) - STEPS is a python package for exact stochastic simulation of reaction-diffusion systems in arbitrarily complex 3D geometries.

## Model Databases

* [ModelDB] (https://senselab.med.yale.edu/modeldb/) - Models coded in any language for any environment.
* [Open Source Brain] ( http://www.opensourcebrain.org/) - a resource for sharing and collaboratively developing computational models of neural systems.
